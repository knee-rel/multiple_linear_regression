# Startup Profit Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the profits of startups based on various factors such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. A Multiple Linear Regression model is trained on a dataset containing information about different startups to make these predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project (`50_Startups.csv`) contains the following columns:

- R&D Spend: Research and development expenditure
- Administration: Administration expenditure
- Marketing Spend: Marketing expenditure
- State: State where the startup operates
- Profit: Profit generated by the startup

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```

git clone https://github.com/your_username/startup-profit-prediction.git

```

Install the required dependencies:
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage
1. Run the `startup_profit_prediction.ipynb` notebook to train the Multiple Linear Regression model and make predictions.
2. Explore the code and modify it as needed for your specific use case.
3. Feel free to experiment with different algorithms or feature engineering techniques to improve the model's performance.

## Results
- The trained model's predictions are evaluated on a test set, and the results are displayed.
- Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared can be calculated to assess the model's performance further.
